<h1>Happy Life!</h1>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	<div id="p1">Know Thyself</div><p>
		The first step toward happiness is self-awareness. In order to control how we feel, first we must be able to identify what we feel, then learn to understand why we feel it. If my goal is to find a sense of satisfaction with my life, I must first discover why I feel unsatisfied.</p></div>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	<div id="p2">Embrace Thyself</div><p>
        Self-acceptance might be the hardest stage of this process. In a culture that constantly demands perfection, it is easy to get caught up comparing ourselves to that model of perfection, convincing ourselves that we are never good enough.</p></div>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <div id="p3">Love Thyself</div><p>
    	Self-love means investing in our own well-being and happiness, and it starts by believing that we are valuable and worthy of happiness. Having a positive regard for ourselves changes us from the inside. Fear and doubt are replaced by confidence and positivity.</p></div>
